# Typings from Sin

This directory contains Sin types.

### JSDoc Tags

Use the following jsdoc tags for more detailed descriptors.

```js
/**
 * Use {@link Name} to reference another type.
 *
 * @deprecated
 * When using deprecated tag description is optional but preferred.
 *
 * @param name
 * Description accompanies the param tag on newlines
 *
 * @example
 * s`h1`('Example tag must be expressed last and never before param.')
 */
```

# Testing
